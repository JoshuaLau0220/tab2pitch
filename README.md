ðŸŽ¸ A very, very primitive tab-to-pitch converter.

# Usage

Just run `python3 tab2pitch.py` and enter the tab positions you want to convert. You may use 'x' for muted strings.
The program will output the corresponding pitches.

Supply the `-c|--capo` option to specify a capo position. The program will then output the corresponding pitches.
Negative capo positions are allowed to indicate dropped tunings.

If you have any suggestions, please file an issue or a pull request.
