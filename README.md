ðŸŽ¸ A very, very primitive tab-to-pitch converter.

# Usage

Just run `python3 tab2pitch.py` and enter the tab positions you want to convert. You may use 'x' for muted strings.
The program will output the corresponding pitches.

Supply the `-c|--capo` option to specify a capo position. The program will then output the corresponding pitches.
Negative capo positions are allowed to indicate dropped tunings.

If you have any suggestions, please file an issue or a pull request.

## Example 1: The good old C major chord

```bash
$ python3 tab2pitch.py 0 1 0 2 3 x

# output:
Pitches:
  E4
  C4
  G3
  E3
  C3
  x
```

## Example 2: Some chord with a capo

```bash
$ python3 tab2pitch.py --capo 1 x 6 7 7 x 6

# output:
Pitches:
  x
  F#4
  Eb4
  Bb3
  x
  B2
```
